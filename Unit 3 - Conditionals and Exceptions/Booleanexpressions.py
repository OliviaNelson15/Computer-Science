#Boolean expression: A mathimaticl formula that can onlt evaluate to "true" or "false".
#EXAMPLE: Are my shoees tied? >True
#Is 5 greater than 7? >False
print(5 > 7)

#Comparison operators == > <>= <=
#Kina like arithmetic operators! + - / * ** % //
x=5                 #SET x equal to 5, tell it what to be
print(x = 5)        #GET x = 5
#The difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#AHEM... this is a PERFECT test question... hmmm.... *cough, cough*
