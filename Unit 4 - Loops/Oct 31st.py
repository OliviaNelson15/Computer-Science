#Python has 4 types of collections
#Tuple
#Set
#list
#Dictionary

#Today we will focus on listsssssssssss
#A list is a way to store more that one value in a variable
#Those values  in the list are called "items"
#ITEMS can be accessed by their index, which is there position in the list.
#INDEX                      0                       1               2               3

best_elden_ring_weapons = ["Blashphemous Blade", "Moonveil", "Rivers of Blood", "Iron Ball"]
#INDEX          0   1       2   3
best_years = [1776, 1985, 1993,1957]

#Print the best elden ring weapon
print(best_elden_ring_weapons[0])

print(len(best_elden_ring_weapons))

#Add new item to the end of a list
best_elden_ring_weapons.append
import random
numbers = [random.randint(1,100), random.randint(1,100), random.randint92,100]
print(numbers)
print(max(numbers))
print(min(numbers))

#Strings are lists! They're just a list of characters.
#List items can be changed.

best_elden_ring_weapons.pop()
#the .pop() function removes an item on a list by its position on the list
