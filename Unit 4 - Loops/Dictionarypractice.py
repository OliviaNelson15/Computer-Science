#We're no strangers to love
#You know the rules, and so do I
#A full committment's what I'm thinking of
#You wouldn't get this from any other guy

#I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
#Gotta make you understand


#Never gonna give you up
#Never gonna let you down
#Never gonna run around and desert you
#Never gonna make you cry
#Never gonna say "goodbye"
#Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you

#We've known each other for so long
#Your heart's been aching but, you're too shy to say it
#Inside we both know what's been goin' on
#We know the game and we're gonna play it

#And if you ask me how I'm feeling
#Don't tell me you're too blind to see

#Never gonna give you up
#Never gonna let you down
#Never gonna run around and desert you
#Never gonna make you cry
#Never gonna say "goodbye"
#Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you

#Never gonna give you up
#Never gonna let you down
#Never gonna run around and desert you
#Never gonna make you cry
#Never gonna say "goodbye"
#Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you
